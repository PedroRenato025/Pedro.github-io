   <p>
    Clash royale was released in 3/2/2016 by supercell, is an strategy game, qhere you build a deck with 8 cards and battle with other players for win. When this game was released it has had great success in the gaming community, inspiring the creation of several other games, currently the Clash Royale not is a very popular game, because the people stop of play, because it doesn't have a good variation of modes so people got sick of it and stopped playing, but at its peak the game was always at the top of the most played games.
