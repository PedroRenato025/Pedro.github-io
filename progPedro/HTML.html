                    I'm in seventh year In the Univap, a many people in my class call me just Pedro, but some call me Renato. I have history, geography, math A and B, science, P.E,english, Portuguese Etc, most classes were always chaos, because of my colleagues, they don't know when they could make funny or  when to talk, my class was the Most hated by teachers and the boss, we already had to spend two weeks without leaving the room during breaks, because the teacher's cell phne was broken, But that's nothing compared to other things my classroom already does.
